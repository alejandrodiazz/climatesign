  <p>The Climate Clock is the effort of a diverse group of students, faculty 
  and alumni who seek to share the urgency of the climate crisis with the wider 
  community in order to raise awareness and spark action. As members of the 
  younger generations, who will experience the impacts of decisions made by 
  those in power today, we feel it is imperative to make our voices heard.</p>
  
  <p>Currently, there is no everyday measure that informs us about the health 
  of our planet. The MIT Climate Clock presents to the MIT community and to the 
  wider world essential information about the climate emergency that is here now. 
  The purpose of the Climate Clock is not to frighten or politicize, but to raise 
  awareness of troubling scientific measures and to motivate people to come 
  together to plan for our collective health and safety. Our role is to be one 
  warning beacon among many.</p>

	 They write that, "greenhouse gas emissions are still rising, with increasingly 
	 damaging effects," and that, "with few exceptions, we are largely failing to 
	 address this predicament."</p>
	 
	 <p>This warning draws on a long history of scientists raising alarms about

   <div class="section-title-group">
       <h3 class="section-heading centered">Carbon Dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) Accounting Guide</h3>
   </div>
	 
	 <p>In order to figure out the time available for action, one can compute a carbon dioxide budget. 
    The budget answers the question "how much carbon dioxide can we put into the atmosphere, 
    globally, before reaching 1.5&deg;C above pre-industrial levels?"</p>
    
    <div>To solve for the budget, one needs to know the "account limit" and the expenses.</div>
    
    <h3>The Account Limit: Carbon Dioxide Threshold</h3>
    <p>Using measurements and models, scientists calculated the maximum amount of carbon dioxide
    that can be in the atmosphere without exceeding a certain average temperature above 
    pre-industrial levels by 2100.  The number is approximately 400 giga-tonnes of carbon dioxide
    [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf">IPCC AR6</a>].</p>
    
    <h3>The Expenses: Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide</h3>
    <p>But how much carbon dioxide is already in the atmosphere? Measurements are taken regularly 
    at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii. At the start of 2022, there was 
    already <a  target="_blank" href="https://climate.nasa.gov/vital-signs/carbon-dioxide/">417 
    ppm of carbon dioxide</a> in the atmosphere, up from under 300ppm in 1950 
    [<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_Full_Report.pdf">IPCC 
    AR6</a>, A.1.1]. Every year that more carbon dioxide is emitted into the atmosphere, 
    atmospheric carbon dioxide "expenses" increase. By the same token, as we reduce our 
    CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, or sequester carbon, our expenses decrease. If our sequestration 
    equals our emissions, we've hit "net-zero," such that we're removing as much carbon 
    from the atmosphere as we're putting into it.</p>
    
    <h3>The Balance: CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Budget</h3>
    <p>The balance is simply the limit minus the carbon dioxide already in the atmosphere. We 
    call this number the "CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions Budget." It decreases each day as 
    more carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere.</p>
    
    <p>For more resources describing carbon budgets, see 
    <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yls5GSePw-A">Climate 
    Change: What is the carbon budget?</a>  and <a target="_blank" 
    href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blsTXGFdeDk">The Carbon Budget - what 
    is it and why is it important?</a></p>
    
    <h3>Arriving at a CO<sub>2</sub> Budget</h3>
    <p>To convert the carbon dioxide budget into a countdown clock, we make assumptions about 
    our world. We assume that global carbon dioxide emission rates stay fixed, and calculate 
    how much time is left before the budget is used up. We use the assumption that 
    the CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions budget is reduced by 42.2 Gt of CO<sub>2</sub> per year, or 1,337 tonnes/sec 
    based on this reference: <a target="_blank" 
    href="https://www.mcc-berlin.net/en/research/co2-budget.html">Mercator Research 
    Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC)</a>. 
    The Mercator Research Institute relies on data from the recent IPCC Special Report 
    on Global Warming of 1.5&deg;C . Calculations are based on the year 2020, counting 
    down the expended carbon budget from there. The budget specifically addresses 
    carbon dioxide, not directly including additional greenhouse gasses such as 
    methane. Carbon dioxide is particularly important, as it remains in the atmosphere 
    on the order of <a target="_blank" 
    href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2915/the-atmosphere-getting-a-handle-on-carbon-dioxide/">300-1000 years</a>.</p>
    
    <p>There are other limitations to our budget calculation. The annual emissions of 
    42.2 Gt-CO<sub>2</sub>/yr from the MCC include sources like "burning fossil fuels, industrial 
    processes and land-use change". They do not factor in additional emissions from 
    long-term changes in natural sources and sinks due to potential thresholds and 
    tipping points, such as such as permafrost melting causing the release of gas 
    hydrates, melting of the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets, slowing down the 
    North Atlantic deep ice circulation or the dieback of the Amazon rainforest. 
    While the effects of these natural sources are large, the timescale for these 
    changes may be on the order of decades to centuries, which is much longer than 
    the timescale of our climate clock. Thus we chose not to include these in the 
    budget (but will continue to revisit those issues).</p>
    
    <p>COVID-19 temporarily changed our global carbon dioxide emission rate. According to 
    the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.globalcarbonproject.org/carbonbudget/20/highlights.htm">Global 
    Carbon Project</a> report from December 11, 2020, "Total CO<sub>2</sub> emissions 
    from human activities (from fossil CO<sub>2</sub> and land-use change) are set to 
    be around 40 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2020, compared to 43 billion 
    tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub> in 2019." Furthermore, "global fossil CO2 emissions are 
    expected to decline approximately 2.4 billion tonnes of CO2 in 2020 (-7%), a record 
    drop. The decrease in emissions, caused by COVID-19 confinement measures in place, 
    brings global fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions to 34 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>... Emissions in 2019 
    were only 0.1% above emissions in 2018, at 36.4 billion tonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>."</p>
    
    <p>Since 2020, we have begun to see a rebound effect, however. Thus we can approximate 
    total annual emissions, mostly from fossil fuels and land use changes, as 42.2 
    GtCO2 for the purposes of our climate clock.</p> 
    
    <p>Of course there is uncertainty in our future emissions. Our goal is not to predict 
    the future, but rather to ignite action to move towards a liveable future for humanity. 
    Visit the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u7qVLiShOU">Global 
    Carbon Project</a> to learn from scientists about how international responses to COVID-19 
    have impacted emissions, and thus the carbon dioxide budget.</p>
    
    <h3>Measuring the Progress of Renewable Energy</h3> 
    <p>Energy produced from burning fossil fuels contributes more than any other source 
    to the increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Sourcing energy from 
    renewables instead means less carbon going into the atmosphere. It was estimated 
    in the World Energy Special Report 2021 by BP that in 2020, 12.55% of the world's 
    energy came from renewable sources and hydro-electric: 5.7% from renewables, and 
    6.86% from hydro [<a target="_blank" 
    href="https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/business-sites/en/global/corporate/pdfs/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-stats-review-2021-full-report.pdf">World 
    Energy Special 2021 Report</a>, page 11]. Including nuclear 
    leads to ~16.8%. Energy consumption consists of electricity, transport and heating 
    energy. When examining just electricity, renewables (including hydro) comprise 
    27.8% of the electricity sources in the world [WE report, page 65].  In 
    our accounting, renewables include solar, wind, hydropower, and modern bio-fuels.  
    We do not include nuclear, or traditional biofuels (such as fuel-wood, forestry 
    products, animal and agricultural waste) in the estimate.  Around the world, even 
    as the supply of energy increases, more and more energy is derived from renewable 
    sources.</p> 
    
    <p>To pass net-zero, the point when globally we begin extracting carbon from the 
    atmosphere, we need this percent to increase as much as possible towards 100%.
    According to World Energy data, the growth rate of renewables (and biofuels, no 
    hydro) for 2020 was 12.5%. In fact, despite decreases in energy consumption, 
    renewable generation still increased. For hydro it was 1% with 4296 Terra-watt-hours 
    of energy from hydro.</p>

    <div>For our computations, we use the following numbers:</div>
    <div>
    2020 renewables (hydro+solar) = 38.16 + 31.71 = 69.87eJ<br />
    2019 renewables (hydro+solar) = 37.69 + 28.82 = 66.51eJ<br />
    2020 total energy consumption = 557.10eJ<br />
    2019 total energy consumption = 581.51eJ<br />

    2020 renewable energy / total = 12.541734%<br />
    2019 renewable energy / total = 11.43746%<br />
    </div>

    <p>For our projection, we begin at 12.541734% at the middle of 2020, and approximate 
    the increase of renewables based on 3.501617*10^-8 %/sec, which comes from 
    (12.541734%-11.43746%)/(365*24*3600s).  If nuclear were included as a low-carbon 
    source, the lifeline would be roughly 4.24% higher.</p>

		 <p>The MIT Climate Clock team ultimately opted not to do the clock as a hack, 
		 but instead to pursue MIT Administration approval, because we sought to display 
		 the climate clock in the most fitting location on campus &mdash; the top of the 
		 Department of Earth Atmospheric and Planetary Science building &mdash; and to do 
		 so long-term. Like clocks in medieval town centers, we wanted our clock to 
		 be seen every day at the center of our campus.</p>

  people using <a target="_blank" href="https://www.climateinteractive.org/en-roads/">Climate 
  Interactive's En-ROADS</a> simulator to learn about the climate.  
  Plant-based ice cream served in compostable dishes was served to showcase 
  sustainable food solutions.</p>

  <p>This project has given us hope. As one team member, Jenning Chen, MIT'21, 
  puts it  "I am a senior. I am graduating after four years. Yet this is the 
  best thing I have ever done at MIT."</p>
  
  <p>History has shown that with united action, we can have a global impact. 
  It's been done before. For example, as a direct result of global actions 
  taken after signing the historic Montreal Protocol, <a target="_blank" 
  href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2020nasa-data-aids-ozone-hole-s-journey-to-recovery">satellite data</a> has shown 
  that the ozone hole has healed.</p>
  
  <p>In 2021, climate campaigners at the Glasgow, Scotland Conference of the 
  Parties COP26 turned out in huge numbers, massively exceeding expectations. 
  Youth-led groups, such as Friday for the Future, Extinction Rebellion and 
  the Saturday Global Day of Action showed that the climate movement by youth 
  and ordinary citizens matters and can make a difference.</p>
  
  <p>Humans are a powerful species &mdash; we have changed the climate of the entire 
  planet without intending to. Now, with conscious effort and the force of a 
  committed global community, we must help create a livable climate to survive.  
  By acting together, we can turn this emergency into an opportunity to create 
  a better world. The ultimate goal that we aspire to is a habitable and 
  equitable planet for all humans and all life on Earth.</p>

<h2 class="section-heading centered">Team</h2>

<div>
<p>The Climate Clock projections have been a sustained effort on the part of an outstanding 
team. The undergraduate and graduate cross-disciplinary team comes from Electrical 
Engineering and Computer Science, Mechanical Engineering, Aero-Astro, Chemistry, the 
Media Lab, as well as Harvard University Law and Medical Schools, all tied together 
through the D-Lab class project.</p>
<p>Original team members include <a target="_blank" href="https://alejandrodiazz.github.io/">Alejandro Diaz (MIT'21, Course 6.2)</a>, Gabriela 
Cazares (MIT'2020, Course 5, now in a Ph.D. at UC-Berkeley studying atmospheric 
chemistry) and Lowry Yankwich, Harvard Law School '22, all three of whom kicked 
off the pre-Climate Clock project during summer 2020.</p>
<p>In 2020, the team was joined by alumna Jillian James, MIT'10, '16, Course 16, 
who has supported all aspects of the work. Spring 2021 term added new team members 
Jenning Chen (MIT'21, Course 6.3) who worked with Alejandro to do all the programming, 
as well as  Gaurav Patekar, MIT'21, Media Lab, who did major design work with 
Alejandro to ensure that the Climate Clock actually went live, first in Spring 
2021 and then Fall/Winter 2021. Our team leaders and mentors are Susan Murcott 
(MIT'92), Lecturer, MIT D-Lab and Julie Simpson, Research Engineer, MIT Sea Grant.</p>
